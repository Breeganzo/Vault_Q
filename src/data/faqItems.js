    question: 'Is Vault Q a coaching institute or a university?',
    answer:
      'Neither. Vault Q is a mentorship and research guidance platform. We help students find clarity in their research journey through curated topics, honest advice, and affordable one-on-one sessions. We don\'t offer degrees, certifications, or classroom coaching.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will you write my thesis or project for me?',
    answer:
      'No. We strictly provide guidance, structure, and direction. All academic work must be done by you. We believe in building your skills, not doing your work for you. This keeps things ethical and actually helps you grow.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is your pricing so affordable?',
    answer:
      'We keep overheads low and focus on genuine help rather than fancy branding. No fancy offices, no 50-person teams, no inflated "course" prices. You pay for the time and expertise you actually use — nothing more.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I only need help with one specific thing?',
    answer:
      'That\'s completely fine! Our "Quick Clarity" session is designed for exactly this. One question, one session, one clear answer. No pressure to buy a bigger package.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get a refund if I\'m not satisfied?',
    answer:
      'For research topics, since they are exclusive (one student per topic), refunds are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. For guidance sessions, if you feel the session wasn\'t helpful at all, reach out to us and we\'ll work something out. We\'re reasonable people.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know the research topics are good?',
    answer:
      'Every topic is curated based on current research trends, feasibility for student-level projects, and practical relevance. We don\'t list random ideas — each topic comes with enough context for you to evaluate it before purchasing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is this only for Biotechnology and Microbiology students?',
    answer:
      'Primarily, yes — our expertise is strongest in Biotechnology, Microbiology, and Life Sciences. However, general research guidance (proposal writing, literature review strategies, career roadmap) applies broadly to any science student.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens after I purchase a topic?',
    answer:
      'Once your payment is confirmed, the topic is exclusively yours — no one else can purchase it. You\'ll receive guidance on how to approach the topic, key references, and you can book a follow-up session to discuss your plan.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How quickly will I get a response?',
    answer:
      'We typically respond within 4–6 hours during business hours. For urgent queries, WhatsApp is usually faster than email.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you help with CSIR-NET, GATE, or DBT-JRF preparation?',
    answer:
      'We don\'t offer exam coaching or study material. However, our Career & Research Roadmap session can help you plan your preparation strategy, understand the exam pattern, and prioritize topics based on your strengths.',
  },
