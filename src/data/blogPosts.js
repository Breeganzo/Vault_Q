## The Problem

Every student hits this wall: your guide says "choose a topic," and suddenly you're staring at a blank page wondering if you should work on cancer biomarkers, antimicrobial resistance, or something involving CRISPR because it sounds impressive.

Let's take a step back.

## Start With What You Actually Find Interesting

Not what sounds impressive. Not what your friend is doing. Not what has the most "scope." What genuinely makes you curious? If you enjoyed a particular subject in class, that's a valid starting point.

## Check Feasibility Before Falling in Love

A great topic that you can't actually do in your lab, with your resources, in your timeframe — is not a great topic. Ask yourself:
- Do I have access to the required equipment and reagents?
- Can I complete this in the time I have (usually 6–12 months)?
- Is my guide comfortable supervising this area?

## Read Before You Decide

Spend 2–3 days reading recent review papers in your area of interest. Not full research papers yet — just reviews. This gives you a bird's-eye view of what's been done and what gaps exist.

## The Sweet Spot

Your ideal topic sits at the intersection of:
1. **Your interest** — you'll be working on this for months
2. **Feasibility** — you can actually do it
3. **Novelty** — it adds something, even if small, to existing knowledge
4. **Your guide's expertise** — they should be able to help you

## Don't Aim for a Nobel Prize

Your MSc project is a learning exercise. It's okay if the topic isn't groundbreaking. What matters is that you learn the process of research — asking questions, designing experiments, analyzing data, and communicating results.

## When in Doubt, Talk to Someone

Sometimes a 30-minute conversation with someone who's been through this can save you weeks of confusion. That's exactly what Vault Q is here for.

    title: '5 Mistakes Students Make in Their First Research Proposal',

    category: 'Proposal Writing',
    excerpt:
      'Your first research proposal doesn\'t have to be perfect, but avoiding these common mistakes will save you from unnecessary rejections and rewrites.',
    content: `
## Mistake 1: Starting with the Title

Students often try to finalize the title before they've even figured out their objectives. Your title should be the last thing you write — it's a summary of your entire proposal.

**Do this instead:** Start with your research question. What are you trying to find out?

## Mistake 2: Vague Objectives

"To study the effect of X on Y" is not a clear objective. What effect? How will you measure it? What's your hypothesis?

**Do this instead:** Write SMART objectives — Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.

## Mistake 3: Copy-Pasting the Literature Review

Your literature review should tell a story that leads to your research question. It's not a collection of summaries of random papers.

**Do this instead:** Organize your review thematically. Each paragraph should build toward explaining why your study is needed.

## Mistake 4: Unrealistic Methodology

Planning to use equipment your lab doesn't have, or techniques you've never been trained in, is a recipe for disaster.

**Do this instead:** Visit your lab. Talk to seniors. List what's available. Design your methodology around what you can actually do.

## Mistake 5: Ignoring the "So What?" Question

If someone reads your proposal and thinks "so what?" — you haven't communicated the significance of your work.

**Do this instead:** Clearly state the practical or theoretical implications. Even a small contribution matters, but you need to articulate it.

## The Bottom Line

Your first proposal won't be perfect, and that's completely okay. The goal is to learn the process. Each revision makes it better. And if you're stuck, a fresh pair of eyes (or a guidance session) can make all the difference.

    title: 'What is a Synopsis and Why Does Your College Want One?',
    date: '2026-01-18',
    author: 'Vault Q',
    category: 'Getting Started',
    excerpt:
      'A synopsis is basically a mini-proposal. Here\'s what it should contain, why colleges ask for it, and how to write one without overthinking it.',
    content: `
## What Exactly is a Synopsis?

A synopsis is a concise document (usually 3–8 pages) that outlines your proposed research. Think of it as a trailer for your project — it gives the reviewers enough information to understand what you plan to do, why, and how.

## Why Do Colleges Ask for It?

Three reasons:
1. **To check feasibility** — Can you actually do this in the given time and resources?
2. **To assess understanding** — Do you know what you're getting into?
3. **To assign guides** — Faculty need to know what you're proposing so they can decide if they can supervise it.

## What Should a Synopsis Include?

Most colleges follow a similar format:

### 1. Title
Clear, specific, and descriptive. Avoid being too broad ("A Study on Bacteria") or too narrow.

### 2. Introduction
Brief background of your area. 1–2 paragraphs. End with the gap your study addresses.

### 3. Objectives
2–4 specific, measurable objectives. These are the backbone of your synopsis.

### 4. Review of Literature
A brief review (not exhaustive). Show that you've read enough to understand the context.

### 5. Methodology
What you'll do, how you'll do it, what tools/techniques you'll use. Be specific but concise.

### 6. Expected Outcomes
What do you hope to find? Be realistic.

### 7. References
Properly formatted. Follow your college's preferred citation style.

## Common Mistakes

- Writing the synopsis after your guide tells you the topic (you should contribute to topic selection)
- Making it too long (a synopsis is NOT a thesis)
- Using jargon without explanation
- Not aligning objectives with methodology

## Pro Tip

Write your objectives first, then build everything around them. Your introduction should lead to them, your methodology should address them, and your expected outcomes should answer them.

If this still feels overwhelming, we're here to help. A single guidance session can give you the clarity you need to write a solid synopsis.
